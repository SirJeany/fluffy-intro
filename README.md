Our introductory project, showcasing names, likes, movies in a way that shows out basic html understanding

## Getting Started

Clone Repo and open index.html using a local server.

### Prerequisites

Not much, I used VSCode's 'LiveServer' to host a local server.

### Installing

Download and install gitbash.
Copy the repo's link off Github.
Open gitbash and cd to chosen folder.
run: git clone [repo_link]

## Running the tests

Drop project into VSCode and then use the extention 'LiveServer' to launch the index.html on your local server, automatically.
